It now sits at No. 32 (2014 List), continuing its place as the top restaurant in Australasia. Shewry is passionate about creating culinary delights, but he also likes grabbing his board and going surfing.<br>\n<br>\nThis is typical of the down-to-earth style that characterises so many chefs in Australia’s food and wine scene.<br>\n<br>\nFor Peter Gilmore, one of Australia’s great chefs, with the highly awarded Quay restaurant also featuring in the San Pellegrino World’s Best Restaurants, the remarkable skill he shows in the kitchen – focusing on the texture, harmony and balance of Japanese, Korean and Chinese cuisines - was partly shaped by his early years. “I rely on my own set of sensibilities and experiences of growing up in a multicultural society,” he says.<br>\n<br>\n“We are generally very relaxed and easy-going characters,” says Chinese Australian chef Kylie Kwong. “Our food reflects this – it’s fresh, light and flavoursome. It’s a generous culture, a ‘feel-good’ culture, based on a natural openness and honesty.”<br>\n<br>\nNeil Perry, one of Australia’s best known-chefs whose 25-year career has seen him earn numerous accolades and the deep respect of the industry, works around the clock at his Rockpool empire and as executive chef for Qantas. But you’ll also see him at a humble Chinatown hole in the wall downing a bowl of noodles.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n",

Bill Granger’s popularity continues to grow beyond Australian shores, with his breezy yet benchmark cafe formula winning over crowds in London and Tokyo, while Luke Mangan can add Jakarta, Tokyo, Singapore and Seminyak to his Australian restaurant portfolio.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n",

At the other end of the spectrum are young winemakers who ferment biodynamic wine in huge ceramic eggs or serve it rudely fresh from demijohns on bar counters.<br>\n<br>\nIt’s that relaxed approach that marks Australia’s food and wine community out as being different from the rest of the world. In the same way that customers are encouraged to leave the tie at home, so too chefs, waiters, growers, winemakers, baristas and sommeliers have a down-to-earth approach that is warm, welcoming and unpretentious. “It’s hard for me to put my finger on it, but I think&nbsp; the relaxed, professional, quality blend is what we do so well, and so differently to the rest,” says Andrew McConnell, chef and owner of Melbourne landmarks Cumulus Inc and Cutler &amp; Co.<br>\n<br>\nThere’s also pride that stems from the fact that Australia has never been a more exciting or rewarding place to eat. That extends to a desire to connect with and celebrate Indigenous produce, unique ingredients that can only be found in Australia.<br>\n<br>\nKylie Kwong describes it as “Australia on a plate” which, for her, means integrating native ingredients with the classic Cantonese dishes of her heritage.<br>\n<br>\nUp and coming chefs, too, are embracing the produce around them with a confidence that reflects the maturing of the Australian food culture.<br>\n<br>\nIn just one generation, the Australian palate has moved on from the English-leaning “meat and three veg” approach to the diversity of cuisines enjoyed today and a freedom to explore new flavours and techniques.<br>\n<br>\n“We’re cheeky,” says Australian food writer Jill Dupleix. Without the weight of a large&nbsp; population and long history bearing down upon us, she says, we’re free to experiment and eat what we like.<br>\n&quot;The rest of the world still thinks we’re doing East meets West, or Pacific Rim, but we’re not. We’re doing Australian food, cooked by Australians, for Australians.&quot; - Jill Dupleix<br>\n<br>\nThe Australian food and wine industry is a bounty of passion and self-deprecating humility. It has a democratic mindset that holds firmly to the belief that good food and wine should be accessible to everyone, and an acute sense of itself that is clear in both the people and the food.<br>\n<br>\nBenjamin Cooper, from Melbourne’s Chin Chin, believes there is a warmth to our hospitality and a genuine enthusiasm.<br>\n<br>\n“A lot of it comes down to people,” he says. “Australians have a terrific attitude to dining and cooking. We’ve embraced all these cultures, ditched a lot of the stuffy tradition and bring a genuine passion to what we do.”&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n",

Shewry’s restaurant Attica has garnered the attention of top food critics from Australia and beyond, and is the only Australian restaurant included in the S. Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2014.<br>\n<br>\nAfter moving to Australia, the mild-mannered family man worked with many local heroes including Andrew McConnell and Donovan Cooke among them and not-so-local Australian star David Thompson, whose Thai influence provided early direction for Attica, Ben’s one-and-only restaurant.<br>\n<br>\nBen quickly abandoned stylistic influences with a mix of free thinking, curiosity and natural inclination towards the foraged and found, the wild and the woolly, to create dishes with personal emotional resonance. Ben was foraging before it was popular and has formed tight bonds with a “who’s who” of avant garde international chefs such as Rene Redzepi of Noma, in Copenhagen.<br>\n<br>\nIn 2010, he became the first ever Victorian chef to present at Barcelona's Madrid Fusion, and then in 2011 Ben was the only Australian presenter at the inaugural MAD FoodCamp, hosted by Redzepi.<br>\n<br>\nKnown for his ethical and sustainable approach to cooking, Ben has been recognised for his ‘uniquely imaginative and outstandingly good’ dishes. He is also widely known for foraging raw materials for his dishes from his own garden and his home environment in the Great Ocean Road region of Victoria.<br>\n<br>\nBen’s book Origins, outlining his philosophies and emotional inspirations, was published in 2013. A keen surfer, he remains laidback and down-to-earth despite his remarkable international success.</p>\n",

But the one thing that binds us all together is coffee. You don’t really hear that a place has bad coffee because if a place has bad coffee, they generally close very quickly. In the last five years, the barista has become the rock star. And it’s great that they’re being taken seriously because it’s a craft and we need more of that in our industry.</p>\n",

After farming pheasants with her husband in the Barossa Valley in South Australia, Maggie began producing gourmet food products and now has more than 20 products sold in local and international markets, including Pheasant Farm Pate, quince paste, verjuice and ice creams. She also runs The Farm Shop in the Barossa that stocks her range as well as “picnic fare” and wines.<br>\n<br>\nMaggie opened The Barossa Pheasant Farm Restaurant in 1978 operating it until 1993. Her informed take on country cooking, focusing squarely on her local region and seasonality, was ahead of its time yet inspired by the likes of Alice Waters, in California.<br>\n<br>\nMaggie’s contribution to the Australian food scene has been formally recognised with numerous awards including the Centenary Medal for service to Australian society through food and cooking and writing. In 2010 she was awarded the “Senior Australian of the Year’ and in 2012 was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for “service to the tourism and hospitality industries as a cook, restaurateur and author, and to the promotion of Australian produce and cuisine.”<br>\n<br>\nMaggie has written several books about food and food preparation and has co-hosted the ABC television cooking program The Cook and the Chef and appeared several times as a guest judge and guest masterclass presenter on MasterChef Australia.<br>\n<br>\nMaggie’s signature dish is grape growers roast Barossa chook with grapes and verjuice.</p>\n",

He has run his acclaimed, three-hatted, signature Rockpool restaurant in Sydney since 1989, and now runs six other restaurants: Rockpool Bar &amp; Grill (Melbourne, Sydney and Perth); Rosetta (Melbourne) and Spice Temple (Sydney and Melbourne).<br>\n<br>\nNeil is also a TV presenter, the author of five cookbooks and has been a consultant to Qantas for more than 15 years. He also produces a range of Neil Perry Fresh food products.<br>\n<br>\nNeil grew up in Sydney, the son of a butcher and, briefly, trained as a hairdresser. Restaurants and food grabbed him in his early 20s and few chefs have remained so respected and relevant for such a long period, making the “produce first” mantra his own long before the notion became fashionable.<br>\n<br>\nAn uncompromising approach to what he buys, and how it is handled, is the foundation of the many styles of cooking practiced in his stable (Italian, Szechuan, grill, contemporary Australian haute cuisine.) A chef in the entrepreneurial mould, Neil is probably Australia’s best-connected chef outside the country; widely considered an elder statesman of his culinary generation for his energy, endeavours and prodigious knowledge of what is happening in international restaurant circles.<br>\n<br>\nNeil’s signature dish is wood roast partridge with cherries and almonds.</p>\n",

Peter has been the executive chef at the three-hatted Quay restaurant since 2001, regularly awarded prizes as one of the best restaurants in Australia. It has retained three hats for 10 consecutive years and has been on the San Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants for five years, reaching number 29 in 2012. Peter’s food is “inspired by nature”, with an emphasis on texture, and he sources rare plants and heirloom varieties from local producers.<br>\n<br>\nRaised in Sydney, Peter takes his most profound inspiration from the “natural” cuisine of Michel Bras, in Laguiole, France. Peter worked in relative obscurity around Sydney until the owners of Quay, having spotted his work at the now-defunct De Beers, on Sydney’s far North Shore, gave him the job of head chef and the latitude to follow his muse.&nbsp; That was 2001. Peter’s food is contemporary, light, feminine and entirely original and he is one of a handful of Australian chefs recognised as a peer by an international coterie of great creative chefs.<br>\n<br>\nAs Executive Chef, Peter’s creative and original cuisine has established Quay at the forefront of Australia’s food scene, receiving an unprecedented number of Australian and international awards.<br>\n<br>\nIn 2010, Peter released his first cookbook Quay: Food Inspired by Nature, a sumptuous book which captures Peter’s nature-based philosophy and the organic presentation of his stunning cuisine at Quay.<br>\n<br>\nPeter’s signature dish is XO Sea - poached crustacea and bivalves with a garnish based on the ingredients of a traditional XO sauce.</p>\n",
